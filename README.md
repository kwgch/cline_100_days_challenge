# 100-Day Programming Challenge with Cline

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through a 100-day programming challenge using [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), a VSCode extension designed to assist developers with AI-powered coding support. The AI model used in this challenge is **Google Gemini-2.0-Flash-001**. The goal of this project is to create 100 simple programs using AI coding agents, focusing on HTML and JavaScript applications such as an Othello game.

## Goals

- **Master AI Coding Agents**: Learn how to effectively use AI tools for coding and boost development efficiency.
- **Create a Variety of Programs**: Develop different types of applications, including games and utilities, to acquire a broad range of skills.
- **Enhance Code Quality**: Utilize AI suggestions to write high-quality and efficient code.
- **Explore and Evaluate AI Capabilities**: Assess the strengths and limitations of **Cline** and **Gemini-2.0-Flash-001** in software development.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Use AI-generated suggestions to tackle coding challenges more effectively.

## Challenge Rules

1. Code every day for 100 days.
2. Utilize Cline and AI-generated suggestions to enhance development.
3. Document daily progress, challenges, and learnings.
4. Share key takeaways from using AI in programming.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Cline**: AI-powered VSCode extension
- **Google Gemini-2.0-Flash-001**: AI model for code generation and assistance
- **VSCode**: Primary development environment
- **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**: Core technologies for program development
- Other relevant programming languages and frameworks based on project needs

## Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive evaluation of AI-assisted coding practices
- Improved development efficiency and problem-solving approaches
- A collection of completed projects and documented learnings
- Hands-on experience in integrating AI into daily coding workflows
