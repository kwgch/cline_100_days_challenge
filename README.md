# 100-Day Programming Challenge with Cline

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through a 100-day programming challenge using [cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), a VSCode extension designed to assist developers with AI-powered coding support. The AI model used in this challenge is **Google Gemini-2.0-Flash-001**.

## Goals
- Improve coding efficiency and problem-solving skills with AI assistance.
- Explore and evaluate the capabilities of **Cline** and **Gemini-2.0-Flash-001** in software development.
- Build various projects and document insights gained throughout the challenge.

## Challenge Rules
1. Code every day for 100 days.
2. Utilize Cline and AI-generated suggestions to enhance development.
3. Document daily progress, challenges, and learnings.
4. Share key takeaways from using AI in programming.

## Daily Log
A daily log will be maintained in the `logs/` directory, capturing:
- Tasks completed
- AI-generated suggestions and their effectiveness
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Personal reflections

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cline**: AI-powered VSCode extension
