# Project Brief

## Project Title
Rolling Ball Maze Game

## Project Goal
Develop a 3D rolling ball maze game that can be played on smartphones and PCs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Babylon.js. The game should use touch/mouse drag or keyboard input to control the tilt of the maze, and should not rely on device orientation sensors.

## Core Requirements
-   Implement a 3D maze environment.
-   Simulate ball physics using a physics engine.
-   Implement touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.
-   Implement a level system with multiple maze stages.
-   Display level information, level time, and total time in the UI.
-   Ensure the game is playable on both smartphones and PCs.
-   Do not use device orientation sensors.

## Scope
The project will focus on the core gameplay mechanics and a simple level system. Advanced features such as a level editor, complex physics interactions, or detailed graphics are out of scope.
