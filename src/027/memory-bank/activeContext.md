# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing the core gameplay mechanics, including the 3D maze environment, ball physics, and touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.

## Recent Changes
-   Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project goals and requirements.
-   Created `productContext.md` to describe the product vision and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
-   Create the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
-   Implement the basic structure of the HTML file, including the canvas element and UI elements.
-   Implement the basic styling of the CSS file.
-   Implement the core game logic in the JavaScript file, including the Babylon.js initialization, scene setup, and input handling.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
-   Choosing the appropriate physics engine (Oimo.js or Cannon.js).
-   Designing the maze structure and level system.
-   Implementing the touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.
