# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implement floor transparency and fine-tuning the physics and controls to make the ball roll smoothly and responsively.

## Recent Changes
-   Created the core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
-   Created the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
-   Implemented the 3D maze environment using Babylon.js.
-   Implemented the ball physics using a physics engine.
-   Implemented the touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.
-   Added different colors to the walls, floor, and ball.
-   Applying impulse to the ball based on the tilt of the maze.
-   Implemented the maze generation feature using recursive backtracking algorithm.
-   Refactored the code into separate modules.
-   Fixed issues with floor and wall rotations.
-   Increased input sensitivity.
-   Implemented floor transparency.
-   Changed the control scheme to update the physics engine's gravity vector dynamically based on input tilt instead of rotating the maze.
-   Adjusted InputManager to clamp tilt values and avoid cumulative tilt increase.
-   Increased gravity vector multiplier to make the ball roll faster.
-   Reduced ball friction to allow smoother and faster rolling.
-   Replaced alert-based stage clear notification with an HTML overlay message.

## Next Steps
-   Fine-tune the physics and controls to make the ball roll smoothly and responsively.
-   Implement the level system.
-   Implement the UI elements.
-   Test the game on both smartphones and PCs.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
-   Determining the appropriate impulse magnitude for the ball.
-   Designing the level system and maze layouts.
-   Implementing the UI elements and their functionality.
-   Balancing gravity vector magnitude and friction for optimal ball rolling speed and control.
