# Progress

## What Works
-   Created the core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
-   Created the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
-   Implemented the 3D maze environment using Babylon.js.
-   Implemented the ball physics using a physics engine.
-   Implemented the touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.

## What's Left to Build
-   Implement the level system.
-   Implement the UI elements.
-   Test the game on both smartphones and PCs.

## Current Status
The 3D maze environment, ball physics, and touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze have been implemented. The central box has been removed, and walls have been added to contain the ball. The maze now tilts based on user interaction. The next step is to implement the level system.

## Known Issues
-   None at this time.
