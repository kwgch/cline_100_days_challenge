# Progress

## What Works
-   Created the core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
-   Created the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files.
-   Implemented the 3D maze environment using Babylon.js.
-   Implemented the ball physics using a physics engine.
-   Implemented the touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze.
-   Added different colors to the walls, floor, and ball.
-   Applying impulse to the ball based on the tilt of the maze.
-   Implemented the maze generation feature using recursive backtracking algorithm.
-   Refactored the code into separate modules.
-   Fixed issues with floor and wall rotations.
-   Increased input sensitivity.
-   Implemented floor transparency.

## What's Left to Build
-   Fine-tune the physics and controls to make the ball roll smoothly and responsively.
-   Implement the level system.
-   Implement the UI elements.
-   Test the game on both smartphones and PCs.

## Current Status
The 3D maze environment, ball physics, and touch/mouse and keyboard controls for tilting the maze have been implemented. The ball now has a darker color. The ball is supposed to roll based on the tilt of the maze, and the controls are more responsive. The maze generation feature has been implemented and integrated into the game. The code has been refactored into separate modules. The floor is now transparent.

## Known Issues
-   The ball is not rolling smoothly and responsively when the maze is tilted.
