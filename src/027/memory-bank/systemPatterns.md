# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The game will be a single-page web application consisting of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The JavaScript file will use the Babylon.js library to render the 3D maze environment and simulate the ball physics.

## Key Technical Decisions
-   Using Babylon.js for 3D rendering and physics simulation.
-   Using touch/mouse drag and keyboard input for controlling the maze tilt.
-   Implementing a level system with multiple maze stages.

## Design Patterns in Use
-   Module pattern for organizing the JavaScript code into logical modules (e.g., Game, SceneManager, PhysicsManager, InputManager, LevelManager, UIManager).
-   Observer pattern for handling input events and updating the game state.

## Component Relationships
-   The `Game` module will be the main entry point of the application and will manage the other modules.
-   The `SceneManager` module will be responsible for creating and managing the 3D scene, including the maze, ball, and camera.
-   The `PhysicsManager` module will be responsible for simulating the ball physics.
-   The `InputManager` module will be responsible for handling user input and updating the maze tilt.
-   The `LevelManager` module will be responsible for managing the level data and generating the maze.
-   The `UIManager` module will be responsible for updating the UI elements.
