# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The game will be built using a modular architecture, with separate modules for game management, data loading, UI rendering, input handling, and feedback.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript for broad compatibility and offline functionality.
- Mobile-first design approach with responsive layout for PC compatibility.
- Use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for UI layout.

## Design Patterns
- Module pattern for JavaScript code organization.
- Event-driven architecture for handling user interactions and game state changes.

## Component Relationships
- GameManager orchestrates the game flow and interacts with other modules.
- DataLoader loads and validates game data.
- UIRenderer dynamically generates and updates DOM elements.
- InputHandler processes user input from touch and click events.
- FeedbackSystem provides visual feedback to the user based on game events.
