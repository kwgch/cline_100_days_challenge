System architecture; key technical decisions; design patterns in use; component relationships.

The system follows a basic structure:

*   **HTML (index.html):** Defines the structure of the game board and UI elements.
*   **CSS (style.css):** Styles the game elements for visual presentation and responsiveness.
*   **JavaScript (game.js):** Implements the game logic, handles user input, and updates the game state.

Key decisions include using vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and responsiveness, and CSS grid for the game board layout.
