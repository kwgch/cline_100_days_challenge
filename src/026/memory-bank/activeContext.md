# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing the core game logic, including paddle movement, ball physics (basic collision detection), and brick destruction.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to define project goals and context.

## Next Steps
- Create `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` to document the system architecture and technologies used.
- Implement basic paddle and ball movement in `game.js`.
- Implement brick creation and destruction.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Deciding whether to use the Babylon.js physics engine or implement manual collision detection. For now, I will implement manual collision detection.
