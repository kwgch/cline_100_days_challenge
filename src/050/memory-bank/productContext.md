# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional image generation tools often require technical expertise or artistic skills. Users without these skills may find it difficult to create images that match their aesthetic preferences. Additionally, exploring the space of possible images can be overwhelming without guidance.

## Solution
The Genetic Algorithm Image Sorting App provides an intuitive way for users to explore and evolve images based on their preferences without requiring technical knowledge. By using a familiar Tinder-like interface, users can easily indicate their preferences, and the genetic algorithm does the work of evolving images toward their taste.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Users should be able to understand and use the app without instructions
- **Engagement**: The evolution process should be visually engaging and rewarding
- **Discovery**: Users should be able to discover unexpected and interesting images
- **Satisfaction**: Users should feel that the app is learning their preferences over time
- **Control**: Users should be able to save images they like at any point

## Target Users
- Casual users interested in generative art
- Users looking for unique visual patterns or designs
- Anyone who enjoys the process of discovery and curation
- Users on both mobile devices and desktop computers

## Use Cases
1. **Casual Exploration**: Users browse through generated images during free time, evolving patterns they find appealing
2. **Design Inspiration**: Users looking for unique patterns or designs for creative projects
3. **Educational Tool**: Users learning about genetic algorithms through visual feedback
4. **Art Generation**: Users creating and saving unique generative art pieces

## Success Metrics
- User engagement (time spent interacting with the app)
- Number of generations evolved
- Number of images saved
- User satisfaction with evolved images
