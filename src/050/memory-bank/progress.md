# Progress

## Current Status
- Performed a fifth iteration of refinement on the image generation style in `GeneticAlgorithmManager.js`, specifically increasing the total number of shapes (`numShapes` to 350-550) based on user feedback.
- Memory Bank documentation updated to reflect these iterative changes.
- Core project structure and initial Memory Bank files are in place.

## What Works
- Project requirements and specifications have been documented.
- System architecture has been designed.
- Component responsibilities have been defined.
- `GeneticAlgorithmManager.js` has been updated five times to progressively refine the image generation style.

## What's Left to Build
- [ ] Basic HTML/CSS structure
- [ ] Image generation using Canvas API (Gene generation further refined with increased `numShapes`; `ImageGenerator.js` rendering needs testing with these *latest* genes)
  - [ ] Test and refine the *latest (Iteration 5)* of the dense, grid-aligned image generation, paying attention to performance.
- [ ] Genetic algorithm implementation (beyond initial gene creation)
- [ ] Tinder-like UI with swipe functionality
- [ ] Image saving functionality
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Testing across different devices and browsers

## Known Issues
- The new image generation style has not yet been visually tested.
- Performance implications of generating 80-150 shapes with overlaps are unknown.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning
- Decided on a client-side only application for simplicity.
- Chose Canvas API for image generation due to its flexibility and performance.
- Planned for a Tinder-like UI to make the selection process intuitive.
- Decided to use vanilla JavaScript without external dependencies.

### Implementation Phase (Ongoing)
- **Image Style Update (Iteration 1)**: Initial implementation of densely packed, grid-aligned style (`numShapes` 80-150).
- **Image Style Update (Iteration 2)**: Increased density (`numShapes` 180-280, larger relative sizes, higher min opacity).
- **Image Style Update (Iteration 3)**: Further increased density to "fill the canvas" (`numShapes` 250-400, wider random size ranges).
- **Image Style Update (Iteration 4)**: Focused on increasing minimum shape sizes to better fill space.
- **Image Style Update (Iteration 5 - Current)**: Further increased `numShapes` to 350-550 based on positive feedback and request for more shapes.
- TBD: Specific decisions about mutation strategies for the latest grid-based genes.
- TBD: UI animation and interaction details.
- TBD: Performance optimizations if needed after testing.

### Testing Phase (Upcoming)
- TBD: Browser compatibility issues
- TBD: Mobile responsiveness adjustments
- TBD: User experience improvements
