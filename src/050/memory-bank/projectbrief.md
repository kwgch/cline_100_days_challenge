# Project Brief: Genetic Algorithm Image Sorting App

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that uses genetic algorithms to evolve random shape images based on user preferences. The app presents images in a Tinder-like UI where users can swipe left ("like") or right ("dislike") to influence the evolution of images.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Generate random shape images with random placement
- Create multiple initial images and store them in a queue
- Display images one by one in a Tinder-like UI
- Allow left swipe (or button) for "like"
- Allow right swipe (or button) for "dislike"
- "Liked" images survive and generate two offspring with mutations
- "Disliked" images are removed from the queue
- Allow users to save images they like
- Support both smartphone (touch) and PC (mouse) interactions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive design
- Fast image generation and display
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Client-side only (serverless)

## Project Goals
- Create an engaging and intuitive user experience
- Implement a functional genetic algorithm that evolves images based on user preferences
- Ensure the application works well on both mobile and desktop devices
- Keep the application lightweight and fast
