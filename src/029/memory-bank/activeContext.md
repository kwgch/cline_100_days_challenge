# Active Context: 3D Metaball Visualizer

## Current Work Focus

- Completed implementation of the Three.js scene setup, camera, renderer, and lighting.
- Built metaball creation with randomized radii and cohesive color families.
- Implemented “fluffy” per‑ball GSAP animations to prevent tween accumulation.
- Added tap/click feedback and drag/swipe scene rotation.
- Ensured responsive resize behavior and mobile scroll prevention.
- Integrated Three.js and GSAP via CDN in index.html.
- Created a comprehensive README.md in project root.

## Recent Changes

- Refactored `script.js` to use individual recursive GSAP tweens per metaball, eliminating performance degradation.
- Introduced HSL‑based color families for session‑consistent palettes.
- Loaded Three.js and GSAP from CDN before application script.
- Generated README.md documenting setup, usage, and project structure.

## Next Steps

- Test performance and frame rate stability on a range of smartphones and desktop browsers.
- Fine‑tune animation durations, easing, and color variations based on test feedback.
- Verify absence of memory leaks during long sessions.
- Consider modularizing code if `script.js` grows significantly.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Balancing animation smoothness with CPU/GPU load on lower‑end mobile devices.
- Potential need for further code splitting as features expand.
- Choice of default color families for best visual contrast.
