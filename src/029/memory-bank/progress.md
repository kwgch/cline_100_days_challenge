# Progress: 3D Metaball Visualizer

## What Works

- Three.js scene initialization, camera, renderer, and lighting are functioning.
- Metaballs are created with randomized size and consistent color family palettes.
- Continuous “fluffy” motion via GSAP per‑ball tweens without accumulating memory leaks.
- Tap/click feedback and scale/color animation on metaball interaction.
- Drag/swipe controls for rotating the entire scene.
- Responsive handling of window resize events.
- Mobile scroll prevention on canvas touch.
- CDN integration for Three.js and GSAP.
- README.md presence and content align with project requirements.

## What's Left to Build

- Performance benchmarking on target devices to confirm smooth frame rates.
- UI/UX refinements based on real‑device testing.
- Cross‑browser compatibility checks for WebGL and touch events.
- Optional UI controls for adjusting animation parameters.
- Code modularization if file size or complexity increases.

## Current Status

Core interactive visualization features are fully implemented. Project is ready for testing and optimization.

## Known Issues

- No memory or performance issues detected after tween refactor; monitoring recommended.
