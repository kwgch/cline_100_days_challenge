# Project Brief: 3D Metaball Visualizer

## Core Requirements

- Develop an interactive 3D metaball visualizer using WebGL.
- The application should run smoothly on both smartphones and PCs.
- Implement intuitive controls for manipulating metaballs.
- Ensure a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Goals

- Create a visually appealing and engaging user experience.
- Optimize performance for smooth rendering on mobile devices.
- Implement interactive features such as touch/click response and drag/swipe controls.
- Adhere to clean code principles and maintainable architecture.

## Scope

- 3D metaball rendering using WebGL and Three.js.
- "Fluffy" movement of metaballs within the 3D space.
- Interactive manipulation of metaballs via swipe/drag on smartphones and mouse drag on PCs.
- Touch/click feedback on metaballs.
- Responsive design for smartphones (portrait) and PC browsers.

## Out of Scope

- Advanced shader effects.
- Complex UI elements beyond basic controls.
- Integration with external data sources.
