# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

- Develop an interactive fluid simulation using p5.js.
- Target platform: HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Target devices: Smartphone (portrait, primary) and PC (secondary).
- Implement touch and mouse interactions for controlling the simulation.
- Ensure the app is functional on both smartphone and PC.
- Prevent screen movement on tap for smartphones.

## Goals

- Create a visually appealing and interactive fluid simulation.
- Implement touch and mouse interactions for controlling the simulation.
- Optimize performance for smooth rendering on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Adhere to the design specifications and implementation guidelines.
- Create a README.md file.
- Consider splitting large files into smaller ones.

## Specifications

-   **Touch**: Tap to generate fluid force field, swipe to add directional force, pinch to zoom.
-   **PC**: Mouse drag to simulate swipe, mouse wheel to simulate pinch.
-   **Physics**: Add external forces to a vector field.
-   **Rendering**: Use WebGL for performance.
