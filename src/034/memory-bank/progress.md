# Progress

## What Works

-   Created the initial memory bank documentation.
-   Updated memory bank files with relevant information.
-   Fixed the issue where the drawing was confined to the bottom-right quadrant.
-   Replaced Hammer.js with standard event listeners for touch and mouse interactions.
-   Implemented touch and mouse interactions for controlling the simulation.
-   Implemented zoom control using touch events and mouse wheel.

## What's Left to Build

-   Implement the core fluid simulation logic.
-   Optimize performance for mobile devices using WebGL.
-   Ensure cross-device compatibility.
-   Prevent screen movement on tap for smartphones.
-   Create a README.md file.
-   Consider splitting large files into smaller ones.

## Current Status

-   Memory bank documentation is complete.
-   Project setup is in progress.
-   The drawing is now displayed correctly.
-   Touch and mouse interactions are working correctly.
-   Zoom is working correctly.

## Known Issues

-   Potential conflicts between Hammer.js and native touch events.
