# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Setting up the project structure and initial files.
- Creating the memory bank documentation.
- Implementing touch and mouse interactions.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` with more details.

## Next Steps

- Create `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Populate all memory bank files with relevant information.
- Develop a detailed plan for implementing the fluid simulation.
- Implement Hammer.js for touch gesture detection.
- Add external force application method to the Particle class.
- Manage zoom control variables and transformation matrices.
- Integrate cross-device event handlers.
- Optimize CSS touch actions.
- Switch to WebGL renderer.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- How to best structure the project for maintainability and scalability.
- Which libraries and tools to use for specific tasks.
- How to optimize performance for different devices.
- How to handle potential conflicts between Hammer.js and native touch events.
- Whether to split large files into smaller ones.
