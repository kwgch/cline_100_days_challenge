# Product Context

## Purpose

This project aims to create an engaging and interactive fluid simulation that can be enjoyed on both smartphones and PCs.

## Problems Solved

- Provides a visually stimulating and interactive experience.
- Offers a creative outlet for users to explore fluid dynamics.
- Demonstrates the capabilities of p5.js for creating interactive simulations.
- Addresses the need for a mobile-first design that also works on PCs.

## How it Should Work

The simulation should allow users to interact with the fluid by:

- Tapping to create force fields (smartphones).
- Swiping to apply directional forces (smartphones).
- Pinching to zoom in and out (smartphones).
- Mouse drag to simulate swipe (PCs).
- Mouse wheel to simulate pinch (PCs).

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive and responsive controls.
- Smooth and visually appealing fluid dynamics.
- Cross-device compatibility for seamless experience.
- Optimized performance for smooth rendering, especially on mobile.
- Prevent accidental screen movement on tap (smartphones).
