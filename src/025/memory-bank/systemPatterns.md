# System Patterns: Babylon.js Endless Runner

## System Architecture
The game follows a component-based architecture, with distinct modules for player control, environment management, obstacle handling, and UI.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Using Babylon.js for 3D rendering and game logic.
- Implementing object pooling for performance optimization.
- Using a modular approach to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- Using dynamic textures to create faces on obstacles.

## Design Patterns
- **Object Pooling:** Reusing obstacle objects to reduce garbage collection overhead.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Dividing the game into independent components for better organization.
- **Observer Pattern:** Using events to communicate between components.

## Component Relationships
- **Player:** Handles player input and movement.
- **GroundManager:** Manages the ground tiles and creates the illusion of endless running.
- **ObstacleManager:** Manages the obstacle pool and places obstacles in the scene.
- **InputManager:** Handles touch and mouse input.
- **UIManager:** Manages the UI elements, such as the start screen, game over screen, and score display.
