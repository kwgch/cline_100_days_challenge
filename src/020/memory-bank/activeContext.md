# Active Context: 2-Back Memory Game

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on setting up the basic file structure and implementing the core game logic for the 2-Back Memory Game. This includes:

*   Creating the `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/game.js` files.
*   Implementing the game's core logic for generating stimuli, processing user input, and calculating scores.
*   Designing the basic UI elements for the start screen, game screen, and result screen.

## Recent Changes

*   Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's goals and requirements.
*   Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals of the game.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement the basic HTML structure for the game, including the start screen, game screen, and result screen.
2.  Implement the CSS styles to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
3.  Implement the JavaScript logic for generating stimuli, processing user input, and calculating scores.
4.  Implement local storage to save and retrieve the high score.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **Stimulus Type:** Decide whether to start with numbers, letters, or images as the initial stimulus type. For simplicity, starting with numbers is recommended.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Implement the three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with appropriate stimulus intervals and number of rounds.
*   **UI Design:** Design a clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
