# Project Brief

## Goal
Develop a web application that visualizes the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model running in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

## Core Requirements
- Allow users to input text.
- Load a pre-converted TensorFlow.js DistilBERT model.
- Run inference on the input text.
- Extract attention weights from the model.
- Visualize attention weights using a head view.
- Display the model's prediction.

## Additional Notes
- The application should be mobile-friendly and also work on PC.
- The memory bank should be updated regularly.
- A README.md file should be created.
- Consider splitting files if they become too large.
