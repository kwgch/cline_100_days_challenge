# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to provide a tool for understanding the inner workings of Transformer-based language models, specifically DistilBERT. By visualizing the attention mechanism, users can gain insights into how the model processes and understands text.

## Problems It Solves
- **Black Box Models:** Transformer models are often considered "black boxes" due to their complexity. This tool helps to demystify the model's decision-making process.
- **Lack of Intuition:** Understanding attention mechanisms can be challenging. This tool provides a visual representation to aid in comprehension.

## How It Should Work
The application should allow users to input text, run the DistilBERT model, and visualize the attention weights in an interactive and intuitive manner. Users should be able to select different layers and heads to explore the model's attention patterns.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be easy to use and understand, even for users with limited knowledge of Transformer models.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The attention visualization should be interactive, allowing users to explore different aspects of the model's behavior.
- **Clear and Concise Results:** The model's predictions and attention visualizations should be presented in a clear and concise manner.
