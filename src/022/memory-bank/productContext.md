# Product Context

## Problem
Users need a simple and engaging game that can be played on any device without requiring internet connectivity or external installations.

## Solution
A target click game that is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs directly in the browser. The game will be responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How it should work
The game should present the user with a start screen where they can select the difficulty level. Once the game starts, targets will appear randomly on the screen, and the user must click/tap them to score points. The game will have a timer, and the user's score will be displayed. At the end of the game, the user's score will be displayed, and they will have the option to play again or return to the main menu. High scores will be stored locally.

## User Experience Goals
- The game should be easy to learn and play.
- The game should be engaging and fun.
- The game should be responsive and performant on all devices.
