# Progress

**What Works:**

*   Basic chat interface.
*   Translation language selection.
*   Translation using the Google Translate unofficial API.
*   Responsive design for smartphone compatibility.
*   Avatars for user and bot messages.
*   Message bubbles.
*   Fixed input section at the bottom of the screen.
*   App title and language selector fixed at the top of the screen.
*   Screen zoom disabled on smartphones.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   (Potentially) Implement modules (`config.js`, `api.js`, `utils.js`) for better organization.
*   Further refine the UI and styling.

**Current Status:**

*   The application is functional and meets the core requirements.

**Known Issues:**

*   Reliance on the Google Translate unofficial API, which may be unstable.
