# Product Context: Life Game

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to create an engaging and educational simulation of life, evolution, and herd behavior.

## Problems It Solves
- Provides a visual and interactive way to understand complex biological systems.
- Offers a platform for experimenting with different evolutionary scenarios.

## How It Should Work
The game should simulate organisms with basic AI that allows them to move, eat, reproduce, and interact with each other. The simulation should be visually appealing and easy to understand.

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive controls for adding organisms and observing their behavior.
- Clear visual representation of organism energy, DNA, and herd ID.
- Engaging and educational gameplay.
