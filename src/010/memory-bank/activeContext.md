# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Setting up the project and defining the basic game structure.

## Recent Changes
-   Created `projectbrief.md` to define project goals and scope.
-   Created `productContext.md` to outline the product vision and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
-   Create `systemPatterns.md` to define the system architecture and key technical decisions.
-   Create `techContext.md` to document the technologies used and development setup.
-   Create `progress.md` to track the current status and known issues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
-   Choosing the right technology for the game (e.g., JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas).
-   Deciding on the game's architecture (e.g., object-oriented approach).
