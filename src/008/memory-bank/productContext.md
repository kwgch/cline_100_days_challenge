# Product Context: Space Invaders Game

**Why this project exists:**
This project is being created to demonstrate proficiency in web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), object-oriented programming principles, and design patterns. It serves as a practical application of these concepts in a fun and engaging way.

**Problems it solves:**
This project doesn't solve any real-world problems, but it provides a learning opportunity and a portfolio piece to showcase skills.

**How it should work:**
The game should be playable in a web browser. The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right and shoot bullets. The goal is to destroy waves of descending alien invaders. The game should track the player's score and remaining lives.

**User experience goals:**
- The game should be easy to understand and play.
- The game should be visually appealing and engaging.
- The game should provide a challenging but fair experience.
