# Project Brief

## Goal
To add user interaction to a 3D generative art piece created with p5.js, making it responsive and intuitive on both smartphone (vertical screen) and PC (mouse) environments without adding any UI elements.

## Requirements
- Implement swipe and pinch gestures on smartphones and mouse drag and wheel interactions on PCs to control the art piece's viewpoint and display.
- Ensure the art piece is responsive and optimized for vertical smartphone screens.
- Do not add any UI elements like buttons or sliders.
