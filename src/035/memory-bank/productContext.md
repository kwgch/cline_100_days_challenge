# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to enhance user engagement with a 3D generative art piece by making it interactive and responsive across different devices.

## Problems It Solves
The original art piece lacks user interaction, limiting the user's ability to explore and appreciate the artwork from different perspectives.

## How It Should Work
The art piece should allow users to intuitively control the viewpoint and display through swipe and pinch gestures on smartphones and mouse drag and wheel interactions on PCs.

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience across different devices.
- Allow users to explore the art piece from different angles and perspectives.
- Enhance user engagement and appreciation of the artwork.
