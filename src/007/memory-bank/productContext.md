# Product Context

**Why this project exists:**

This project aims to provide a simple and accessible way for users to translate local text files without relying on online services that may compromise their privacy or require uploading files to a server.

**Problems it solves:**

*   Privacy concerns associated with uploading sensitive documents to online translation services.
*   Lack of offline translation tools for local files.
*   Complexity and cost of using professional translation software for occasional translation needs.

**How it should work:**

The application should allow users to select a local text file, choose a target language, and view the translated text in a side-by-side preview. The translation process should be performed entirely on the client-side using the Google Translate API. Users should be able to download the translated text as a file.

**User experience goals:**

*   The application should be easy to use and require no technical expertise.
*   The user interface should be clean, intuitive, and responsive.
*   The translation process should be fast and efficient.
*   Users should feel confident that their files are being processed securely and privately.
