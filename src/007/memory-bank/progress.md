# Progress

**What works:**

*   Basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
*   File reading functionality.
*   Translation logic using the Google Translate API.
*   Main application logic to handle user interactions.

**What's left to build:**

*   File saving functionality.
*   Improved user interface.
*   Error handling.
*   Progress indicators for long translations.

**Current status:**

The application is in a partially functional state. It can read and translate files, but it cannot save the translated text.

**Known issues:**

*   The Google Translate API is an unofficial API and may be subject to change or limitations.
*   The application does not handle large files efficiently.
*   The application lacks error handling.
