# Active Context

**Current work focus:**

Completing the initial implementation of the local file translation application.

**Recent changes:**

*   Created the basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
*   Added basic CSS styling in `css/styles.css`.
*   Implemented file reading functionality in `js/fileHandler.js`.
*   Implemented translation logic in `js/translator.js`.
*   Implemented main application logic in `js/main.js`.

**Next steps:**

*   Test the application thoroughly.
*   Implement file saving functionality.
*   Improve the user interface.
*   Add error handling.

**Active decisions and considerations:**

*   The Google Translate API is an unofficial API and may be subject to change. Consider alternative translation APIs.
*   The application should handle large files efficiently. Implement progress indicators for long translations.
