# System Patterns

The project follows a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The HTML file represents the view, the JavaScript files represent the controller, and the data (fonts) is the model. The application uses a single-page architecture, with all the logic and UI elements contained within a single HTML file. The CSS file provides the styling for the application.
