# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing the basic Game of Life simulation with standard rules.
- Setting up the grid management and rendering.
- Creating the UI controls for starting, stopping, and stepping the simulation.

## Recent Changes
- Created the projectbrief.md and productContext.md files.

## Next Steps
- Implement the grid module (grid.js) with the ability to initialize, clear, randomize, and render the grid.
- Implement the basic Game of Life simulation logic in the grid module.
- Create the UI controls for starting, stopping, and stepping the simulation in the ui.js file.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- How to optimize the grid rendering for performance on mobile devices.
- Which data structure to use for the grid (e.g., 2D array, TypedArray).
- How to handle touch events on mobile devices.
