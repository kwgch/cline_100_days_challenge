# Progress

**What Works:**

*   Core game logic (tile movement, win condition checking)
*   Responsive user interface
*   Timer and move counter
*   Reset button
*   Solvable board generation
*   HTML element messages

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Implement a game over state and message.
*   Implement local storage for high scores.
*   Implement a "solve" button that brings the user closer to the solution.
*   Add CSS styling to the game clear and game over messages.

**Current Status:**

The game is currently in a playable state, but there are still some features that need to be implemented.

**Known Issues:**

*   The styling of the game clear and game over messages is basic and needs improvement.
*   There is no game over state or message.
*   The "solve" button does not reliably create a near-solved state.
