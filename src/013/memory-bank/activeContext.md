# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

Ensuring that the game is always solvable and displaying game clear/game over messages as HTML elements. Moving memory bank to project root.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Modified `Board.js` to implement the parity check and ensure that the generated boards are always solvable.
*   Modified `UIView.js` to create HTML elements for the messages and display them on the page.
*   Modified `GameController.js` to call the `showGameClearMessage` function.
*   Moved memory bank files to the project root directory.

**Next Steps:**

*   Test the game to ensure that the generated boards are always solvable.
*   Test the game to ensure that the game clear and game over messages are displayed correctly.
*   Address any bugs or issues that are identified during testing.
*   Potentially implement a game over state and message.
*   Update the styling of the game clear and game over messages.
*   Fix the solve button.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   The implementation of the parity check in `Board.js` may impact performance. Need to monitor performance and optimize if necessary.
*   The styling of the game clear and game over messages may need to be adjusted to better fit the overall design.
