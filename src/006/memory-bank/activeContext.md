# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Creating the initial memory bank files and setting up the project structure.

## Recent Changes
- Created the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` files.

## Next Steps
- Create the remaining memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Read all memory bank files to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project.
- Develop a strategy for implementing the catch game based on the specifications and architecture design.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- How to best structure the JavaScript code into modules.
- How to implement the game loop and collision detection efficiently.
- How to create a visually appealing and engaging user interface.
