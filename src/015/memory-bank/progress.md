# Progress

## What Works
- The game has a cannon, projectile, and target.
- The user can control the cannon's angle and power.
- The projectile is fired on a screen click and the distance the projectile travels changes based on how long the mouse button is held down.
- The context menu should no longer appear on right clicks.
- The screen should no longer zoom in on double tap on mobile devices.
- The canvas size is now responsive and the cannon and target positions are adjusted accordingly.
- When the projectile hits the target, the target disappears and reappears in a random location, and "Hit!" is logged to the console.

## What's Left to Build
- Add a hit detection and a simple scoring system to the game.
- Add sound effects to the game.
- Add more levels with increasing difficulty.

## Current Status
The game is in a playable state, but it is missing some key features.

## Known Issues
- The game is not very challenging.
- The game does not have any sound effects.
